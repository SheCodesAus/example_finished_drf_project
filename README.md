# Crowdfunding Back End

This is an example completed back-end for the She Codes Plus course content. It is intended for use in project feedback, to allow mentors to demonstrate techniques and code patterns to students, without needing to write a new app every time. 

It is NOT intended to be shared with students before their DRF projects are submitted, since it includes content they are expected to synthesise themselves.

The deployed back-end can be found here: https://example-finished-drf-project.fly.dev/

## App Name: "Examplify"
Examplify is a crowdfunding app that allows educators to connect students in their classes with tutors who have succeeded in the class previously. 

Educators advertise upcoming exams (i.e., projects) that they need tutors for. Ex-students can pledge their time to help current students study, as long as they achieved a high enough grade on that same exam in a previous class. Educators can specify the grade they require their tutors to have achieved on an exam in order to quality to tutor for it.

> Perhaps a later iteration of this app would have a full set of CRUD endpoints for every model, but the goal of this module was to move fast and break stuff :)
